Just did:
git submodule add https://github.com/jowolf/unify themes/unify

Did not need to do:
git submodule update --init --recursive

But in the future may need to do if you already have the repo but not the submo:
git submodule update --init --recursive

New cloners will need to:
git clone --recursive <project url>
