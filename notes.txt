Colliding files in collectstatic:
joe@mintstudio-rafaela:~/tlg > diff -w /home/joe/tlg/conf/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/js/actions.js /home/joe/tlg/conf/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grappelli_safe/static/admin/js/actions.js

They are similar, buit different.
Look for strange behaviour in admin.

Just did:
git submodule add https://github.com/jowolf/unify themes/unify

Did not need to do:
git submodule update --init --recursive

But in the future may need to do if you already have the repo but not the submo:
git submodule update --init --recursive

New cloners will need to:
git clone --recursive <project url>
